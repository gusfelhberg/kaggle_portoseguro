# Machine Learning Final Project

This repository contains the files my group and I developed for the final project of the course CMPT 826 - Machine Learning at Simon Fraser University where I am currently enrolled in the Professional Master's Program in Big Data.

For this project, we participated in the kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction whose objective was to build a model that predicts the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year. We developed models in Python, R and Matlab and ensemble the results.

Additional details of the experiments we did can be found in the report MachineLearning_FinalProjectReport.pdf.
